I've just finished a 16 week, super-intensive, coding boot camp called [Makers Academy](www.makersacademy.com/). It's one of the best choices I've made and I've lapped up every minute of it. I'm now looking for the next place, somewhere that I take the skills and ideas I've started to learn and progress them to next level.

So how did I get here - after finishing a degree in Physics I wasn't quite sure which direction to go in. I followed the advice of one of my lecturers and started working for a renewable energy company. I've always had a strong passion for making stuff and expected to end up building renewable energy sources - instead I segued in the opposite direction and ended up building pricing models. My primary tools were a laptop and Excel and what really took me by surprise was how much my passion for creating things was being satisfied.

I became obsessed with improving my spreadsheets, from user experience to optimizing speed, adding features and automation I was doing everything to try and make the best spreadsheets possible. I quickly realized my tools were not up to the job and so taught myself VBA and T-SQL, this is when I really got the bug and it soon became apparent that I was going to have to retrain.

## Skills

#### Solving Problems

Puzzles, challenge, games, in any format I love a good problem. Like many people I remember very little of the content from my degree, however what I have hung on to is the ability to solve problems - and at its heart this is what physics is all about. I learnt to break a large problem into smaller ones and use the scientific method to create and test hypothesis. This skill has been absolutely invaluable whilst learning to code as often seemingly insurmountable new challenges can be broken down and tackled one piece at a time.

#### Self Starter

During my time at Good Energy and then Bristol Energy I was responsible for building pricing models. These models forecast costs and margins for a multitude of different customers. The energy industry is very complex and its infrastructure is made up of many different intersecting players. To make things even more complicated its steeped in a constantly shifting policy environment. To price customers effectively I had to have a deep understanding of all these factors as well as making sure I was aware of any changes which might happen in the future.

The knowledge and skills required to do this work were learnt on the job and self taught. I researched policy and taught myself the basics of writing code and managing databases, mainly due to a desire to find out how things worked. It is this attitude towards wanting to learn that makes code so appealing to me - it is a treasure trove of new ideas and concepts waiting to be discovered.


#### Scooping Ice Cream

I'm very good at scooping ice cream:icecream:. I come from a family of ice cream makers in the Welsh borders and grew up scoop in hand. The family business not only makes ice cream but it also sells it at around 40 different events. For three years after university I managed the operational side of the business. This included hiring and managing personnel, negotiating pitches and fees, keeping my own financial records and making sure there was the right amount of stock. I still take the odd turn in an ice cream van but to be honest I'm very happy to have swapped scoop for keyboard.
